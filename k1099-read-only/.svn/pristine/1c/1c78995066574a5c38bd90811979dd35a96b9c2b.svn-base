config I2C_RK28
        tristate " RK28 i2c interface (I2C)"
        depends on ARCH_ROCKCHIP
        help
          This supports the use of the I2C interface on rk28
          processors.

          Using low I2C clock rates may partially work around those issues
          on some systems.  Another serious problem is that there is no
          documented way to issue repeated START conditions, as needed
          to support combined I2C messages.  Use the i2c-gpio driver
          unless your system can cope with those limitations.

config I2C_PARPORT
	tristate "Parallel port adapter"
	depends on PARPORT
	select I2C_ALGOBIT
	help
	  This supports parallel port I2C adapters such as the ones made by
	  Philips or Velleman, Analog Devices evaluation boards, and more.
	  Basically any adapter using the parallel port as an I2C bus with
	  no extra chipset is supported by this driver, or could be.

	  This driver is a replacement for (and was inspired by) an older
	  driver named i2c-philips-par.  The new driver supports more devices,
	  and makes it easier to add support for new devices.

	  An adapter type parameter is now mandatory.  Please read the file
	  Documentation/i2c/busses/i2c-parport for details.

	  Another driver exists, named i2c-parport-light, which doesn't depend
	  on the parport driver.  This is meant for embedded systems. Don't say
	  Y here if you intend to say Y or M there.

	  This support is also available as a module.  If so, the module 
	  will be called i2c-parport.

config I2C_PARPORT_LIGHT
	tristate "Parallel port adapter (light)"
	select I2C_ALGOBIT
	help
	  This supports parallel port I2C adapters such as the ones made by
	  Philips or Velleman, Analog Devices evaluation boards, and more.
	  Basically any adapter using the parallel port as an I2C bus with
	  no extra chipset is supported by this driver, or could be.

	  This driver is a light version of i2c-parport.  It doesn't depend
	  on the parport driver, and uses direct I/O access instead.  This
	  might be preferred on embedded systems where wasting memory for
	  the clean but heavy parport handling is not an option.  The
	  drawback is a reduced portability and the impossibility to
	  daisy-chain other parallel port devices.
	  
	  Don't say Y here if you said Y or M to i2c-parport.  Saying M to
	  both is possible but both modules should not be loaded at the same
	  time.

	  This support is also available as a module.  If so, the module 
	  will be called i2c-parport-light.

config I2C_SIMTEC
	tristate "Simtec Generic I2C interface"
	select I2C_ALGOBIT
	help
	  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for
	  the Simtec Generic I2C interface. This driver is for the
	  simple I2C bus used on newer Simtec products for general
	  I2C, such as DDC on the Simtec BBD2016A.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called i2c-simtec.

config I2C_TAOS_EVM
	tristate "TAOS evaluation module"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	select SERIO
	select SERIO_SERPORT
	default n
	help
	  This supports TAOS evaluation modules on serial port. In order to
	  use this driver, you will need the inputattach tool, which is part
	  of the input-utils package.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  This support is also available as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called i2c-taos-evm.

config I2C_STUB
	tristate "I2C/SMBus Test Stub"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && m
	default 'n'
	help
	  This module may be useful to developers of SMBus client drivers,
	  especially for certain kinds of sensor chips.

	  If you do build this module, be sure to read the notes and warnings
	  in <file:Documentation/i2c/i2c-stub>.

	  If you don't know what to do here, definitely say N.

config I2C_TINY_USB
	tristate "I2C-Tiny-USB"
	depends on USB
	help
	  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the
	  i2c-tiny-usb, a simple do-it-yourself USB to I2C interface. See
	  http://www.harbaum.org/till/i2c_tiny_usb for hardware details.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called i2c-tiny-usb.

	  will be called i2c-versatile.



config I2C_ROCKSOFT
	tristate  "Rockchip gpio algos I2C"
